Step 1: Generate Conflict Numbers

The first step to generate conflict numbers is to generate a graph of courses based on the prereq information.
A BFS is done in both directions, and courses with the same depth will be assigned matching conflict numbers,
to ensure that no two introductory/high level courses can be scheduled at the same time.

The second step of conflict number generation is to look at that faculty information.
Every course being taught by the same faculty member will all be given the same matching conflict number,
to ensure that one faculty does not have to teach multiple courses at the same time.

The third step of conflict number generation is to look at all the coreq information. Any two courses that are coreqs
should share all their current conflict numbers so that they both have the same set of conflict numbers


Step 2: Scheduling

First all courses that are pinned are scheduled, as they must be placed at their existing locked times.

Next all other courses attempt to be placed into the schedule. They start at the earliest time slot on MW,
and check all the other courses scheduled at that time. If they share no conflict numbers with none of the courses,
then the course is placed in that time slot. Otherwise, it will move to the first time slot in TTh. This pattern
continues, going back to the next time slot of MW, etc, until the course is placed succesfully. Once all courses are
placed, the database can be updated.

If two pinned courses share conflict numbers, the user is notified of the conflict, but the algorithm will continue.
If a non-pinned course cannot be placed, the user will be notified and they will have to manually set a time for the course,
as there must be extra information our algorithm does not consider for the placement of this course.
